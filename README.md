# Social-Distance-Monitoring
Developed a real-time social distancing system with YOLOv3 for human detection, OpenCV for video processing, and Perspective transformation for bird's-eye view. Used Euclidean distance for accurate distance measurement, categorizing individuals into high, low, and no-risk groups for monitoring in public areas and workplaces.
